  ## About

  Hey, I'm Maxime Lapointe, I've been coding in Ruby on Rails for over #{Time.now.year - 2013} years now, working mostly
  on a single business application. I also do some open source work here and there.

  I love working on programming tools; things that make life easier for us. However it takes time
  to reach a level of quality and completeness I'm happy with. A good tool will make it easy to build
  upon, a bad one will make that terrible.

  I learned a lot of thing, I'd like to share some of these insights and learn from your feedback.
