<div class="markdown-body"><p>Note: This post mentions and gives examples in Rails, but the content is relevant to anyone using databases systems,
regardless of the use cases.</p>

<p>There are many posts around discussing race conditions in Rails and how to handle/avoid them, but I haven&#39;t seen
one discussion this particular case.</p>

<p>Simply put, race conditions happen when more than one worker/process/thread interact with the same data and
the order those interactions happen in can give undesirable results.</p>

<h2 id="classical-race-condition">Classical race condition</h2>

<p>The classical example of a race condition is having 2 processes altering the same bank account at the same time.
Depending on the order that operations happen in, some of the alterations might be lost.</p>

<p>Starting with 100$, if one process does a +10 and another a -15 at the same time. You can end up with each of the
following amounts in the account:</p>

<ul>
<li>110 (wrong)</li>
<li>85 (wrong)</li>
<li>95 (good)</li>
</ul>

<p>I won&#39;t delve into this since there are already lots of articles about and how to avoid it in Rails.
<a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/blog/avoid-race-condition-in-rails/">Here&#39;s one</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-lesser-known-race-condition">The lesser known race condition</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s think about a single writer and a single reader. Reading some of the articles on Rails race conditions, you
could believe everything will be fine.</p>

<p>Consider the database already contains these two records:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Now if you have a reader doing a report:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">report</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:total</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:published</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:unpublished</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">report</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>And you have a writer adding some data at the same time:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Here are the possible reports you might get:</p>

<ul>
<li>{total: 2, published: 1, unpublished: 1}</li>
<li>{total: 2, published: 1, unpublished: 2}</li>
<li>{total: 3, published: 1, unpublished: 2}</li>
</ul>

<p>One of these is incoherent. You can&#39;t have 2 posts total but then have numbers that add up to 3 at the same time.</p>

<p>This example may feel contrived. It almost always feel like a technicality; the shown result is clearly wrong, but the
database doesn&#39;t end up with wrong data. You can &quot;just&quot; refresh the page the very few times this happens and the
problem will be gone. It&#39;s one of those little glitch that no one can reproduce and no one bothers tracking down
since it doesn&#39;t happen often anyways.</p>

<p>If something like this is in some kind of nightly report, it&#39;s not so easy to &quot;just&quot; refresh the page.</p>

<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait, there&#39;s more!</h2>

<p>You might be tempted to think that this only happens when doing multiple queries on a single table, so you are safe
as lon as you query only once per table. If you define the problem as any incoherency caused by the timing, you would
be wrong.</p>

<p>If the reader does:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># Querying the posts table</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:has_admin_comment</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">has_admin_comment</span> <span class="c1"># an attribute</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># Querying the comments table</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">comments</span> <span class="c1"># Imagine they are rendered in a page</span>&#x000A;<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">report</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>And you have a writer adding some data at the same time:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># A callback will see the post's has_admin_comment</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># Imagine a call</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">comments</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">by_admin: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="n">post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">has_admin_comment: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>There is now the possibility that the report contains a comment by an admin while the <code>has_admin_comment</code> attribute
says there are no such comments.</p>

<p>So as soon as you do 2 queries, if any of the data of those two queries is related to the other query, there is a
chance you&#39;ll encounter this. Bummer, I frequently do more than one SQL query in my pages.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>

<p>The root of the problem is that we are reading data at different points in time, but we want to treat it as if it was
from a single point in time.</p>

<p>The only solution I&#39;m aware of (other than doing only one query), is to tell the database: &quot;Ignore all changes from
elsewhere when working on my queries&quot;. Where elsewhere means other processes / transations.</p>

<p>In PostgreSQL, that can be done with a transaction with the <code>repeatable_read</code> isolation level. From <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/transaction-iso.html">PostgreSQL&#39;s doc</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Repeatable Read isolation level only sees data committed before the transaction began; it never sees
either uncommitted data or changes committed during transaction execution by concurrent transactions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So going back to our first example, if the reader did this instead:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">transaction</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">isolation: :repeatable_read</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">report</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:total</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:published</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;  <span class="n">report</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:unpublished</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">published: </span><span class="kp">false</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">count</span>&#x000A;  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">report</span>&#x000A;<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Then only the 2 valid reports would be possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>{total: 2, published: 1, unpublished: 1}</li>
<li>{total: 3, published: 1, unpublished: 2}</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: In other database systems (such as MySQL or SQLite), it&#39;s possible that you need a different isolation level
than <code>repeatable_read</code>.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-solve-it">When to solve it?</h2>

<p>I think the final question is when should you &quot;solve&quot; this problem? When should you run within a repeatable_read
transaction?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know... It depends.</p>

<p>I have never actually tackled this problem in an application-wide manner... yet. So take these suggestions with a
grain of salt.</p>

<p>Doing more restrictive transactions can have an impact on performance, can add latency, could introduce deadlocks,
could increase the number of transactions that need to be retried. But I&#39;m not sure this is actually a problem in
practice.</p>

<p>When starting a new application, I would consider wrapping every request in a transaction and calling it a day.
It&#39;s too early to focus on scaling/performance in the beginning. The day you grow enough (if that happens) or
encounter problems caused to this, then you can either disable this for some request or start doing it only for
more critical requests.</p>

<p>For existing applications, wrapping every request could cause new problems to appear:</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing race conditions you didn&#39;t know about might now produce an error. (I think this is good)</li>
<li>Nested transactions can behave slightly differently.</li>
<li>Locks will be held longer, possibly resulting in longer latency and deadlocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>So is it worth it to wrap every request for existing application? Your guess is as good as mine. Maybe do it,but progressively?</p>

<p>One thing to consider about this is that while you can &quot;just&quot; refresh a page, it&#39;s not always so simple.
If you are generating a pdf or generating new data from what you queries, then the glitch isn&#39;t quite so temporary
anymore, is it?</p>

<p>So at the very least, you probably want to use the <code>repeatable_read</code> transaction whenever you are generating
something longer lasting than a web page, no matter the consequences.</p>

<h2 id="code-to-apply-everywhere">Code to apply %everywhere</h2>

<p>In my case, for my new application, I&#39;m trying it. It&#39;s barely any code at all.</p>

<p>Here is a callback on my <code>ApplicationController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>around_action :wrap_in_transaction&#x000A;def wrap_in_transaction&#x000A;  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(isolation: :repeatable_read) do&#x000A;    yield&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s that simple! Except... It&#39;s likely your tests may fail, because they also start a transaction, with a different
isolation level.</p>

<p>So add this your your <code>test_helper.rb</code> / <code>spec_helper.rb</code>:</p>

<pre><code># Tests already use a transaction, this tries to nest with a distinct isolation level, which breaks. So skip&#x000A;ApplicationController.skip_around_action :wrap_in_transaction&#x000A;</code></pre>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing words</h2>

<p>Hope you learned something useful!</p>

<p>If you want to play with examples that are similar to the post and demonstrate the effects of the <code>repeatable_read</code>
transaction, here is a <a href="/blog/2023/12/11/the-lesser-known-rails-race-condition.rb">self-contained ruby script</a>.</p>
