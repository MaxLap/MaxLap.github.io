<div class="markdown-body"><p><code>includes</code> is the recommended way to load associations of your records eagerly. In fact, the
<a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#eager-loading-associations">Rails guide for eager loading</a>
only mentions <code>includes</code>. However, there are other ways, and I want to argue that you should
always use <code>preload</code> instead.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s why you should avoid <code>includes</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>includes</code> makes it easy to introduce an odd bug</li>
<li><code>preload</code> takes the same arguments as <code>includes</code>, but only does the safe things</li>
</ul>

<div class="markdown-body"><p>Personally, I find that unexpected.</p>

<p>Imagine if the <code>post</code> is passed to a view or a helper, which uses the <code>comments</code>. It
would only print the comments that matched the condition. Now if you try to debug from that helper,
you would see that <code>post.comments</code> only has 1 comment.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you know that this is how <code>includes</code> (and <code>eager_load</code>, see below) behaves, so you may look
up where the <code>post</code> comes from and figure it out. Good luck otherwise.</p>

<p>This is considered <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#specifying-conditions-on-eager-loaded-associations">a feature</a>.
The consequences of doing conditions on eager loaded association are not in the guide, but they
are in the <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#specifying-conditions-on-eager-loaded-associations">middle of this section of the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>I sometimes see this called &quot;conditional eager loading&quot;, and the bug is doing it accidentally.</p>

<p>I consider the whole feature a maintenance burden. At least the guide doesn&#39;t recommend using it.</p>

<h2 id="tl-dr-my-recommendations">TL;DR: my recommendations</h2>

<p>Things will get more technical in the next sections, so my condensed and straightforward recommendations are:</p>

<ul>
<li>For new code, always use <code>preload</code> instead of <code>includes</code>. It does the same eager loading as <code>includes</code>,
and takes the same arguments, but it ignores the conditions in the query. With it, things work as expected:</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="markdown-body"><ul>
<li><p>If you need a condition (a <code>where</code>) which uses an association, don&#39;t use <code>includes</code> or <code>joins</code>.<br>
Instead, I recommend my gem: <a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc">activerecord_where_assoc</a>.
Here&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md">introduction to it</a>.<br>
It&#39;s made for this purpose, and will support many more use cases, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recursive associations (parent/child)</li>
<li>Polymorphic belongs_to</li>
<li>Negative conditions (ex: posts without comments marked as spam)</li>
<li>Multiple conditions on different records of the same association</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, there&#39;s another gem for this: <a href="https://github.com/EugZol/where_exists">where_exists</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Same as before, posts that have at least one comment marked as spam</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where_assoc_exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><ul>
<li><p>If <code>includes</code> seem to work somewhere that <code>preload</code> doesn&#39;t, you&#39;re probably doing a condition
on an association. See the previous point for this.</p></li>
<li><p>For existing code, you can&#39;t mindlessly change all <code>includes</code> to <code>preload</code>, because some of it may rely on
<code>includes</code> adding a <code>JOIN</code> to the query, which happens when the query refers to the table of the
included associations. So while it would be better to change everything to <code>preload</code>, every such change must
be tested.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So don&#39;t risk <code>includes</code> doing the wrong thing. <code>preload</code> means simple eager loading without the booby trap;
you should use it.</p>

<h2 id="down-the-rabbit-hole">Down the rabbit hole</h2>

<p>If you want to understand why I make those recommendations, we&#39;ll have to get technical...</p>

<p>Eager loading means loading associations of multiple records before they are needed. This is done to reduce
the number of queries executed, making execution faster.</p>

<p>There are actually 3 methods for eager loading in Rails:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>preload</code>: Executes one extra query per association being eager loaded. Same as <code>includes</code> usually does.</li>
<li><code>eager_load</code>: Adds <code>JOIN</code> to the SQL query and load the association without doing an extra query. This also
enables adding conditions on the table, which is the cause of the conditional eager loading bug from the
introduction.</li>
<li><code>includes</code>: Picks between <code>preload</code> and <code>eager_load</code> based on if there is a reference, in the query, to the
table of an association that was passed to <code>includes</code>. This can be from <code>where</code> or from <code>joins</code>.<br>
You may also specify an association with <code>references</code> to force the <code>eager_load</code> path, which is needed when
your conditions are specified with a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>Hash</code> (which, again, causes conditional eager loading).</li>
</ul>

<p>So out of the 3 methods, only one of them cannot trigger conditional eager loading: <code>preload</code>. It only does
full eager loading, always the same way.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-eager_load-needed">When is <code>eager_load</code> needed?</h2>

<p>Rarely...</p>

<p>Maybe some use it to reduce the number of queries when they do eager loading. I don&#39;t think it really saves much,
and there is a risk of slowing things down by making queries that are <span class="with-tooltip" data-tippy-content="If you use `eager_load` with multiple `has_many`, the rows get multiplied, and you end up with a massive amount of data that your DB is returning to your web server.">heavier</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Some may use it to actually do conditional eager loading. I still heavily disagree with that use case.
<button class="spoiler-toggler btn btn-xs btn-aside btn-inline spoiler-toggler--always-displayed">Anecdote</button></p>

<div class="spoiler-target"><div class="markdown-body"><p>I&#39;ve had to edit code that used this &quot;feature&quot; once...</p>

<p>You look at a method and it looks wrong; it can&#39;t be doing what it should be doing. It&#39;s using every
<code>project.users</code>, not just those we want! When I did an interactive console there (<code>binding.pry</code>
or <code>byebug</code>), I saw that users were missing from <code>project.users</code>.</p>

<p>Since I knew of this &quot;feature&quot;, I started looking and, as expected, a condition on an <code>includes</code> was found...
3 method calls away from where the association was used, not a single comment to explain what is going on anywhere.</p>

<p>You should avoid code that looks wrong. Code that uses conditional eager loading looks wrong. In our case
the overall module was already something that we wanted to rewrite from scratch, so this was just another reason
to do so.</p>
</div></div>

<p>I mostly see <code>eager_load</code> used to do a condition (a <code>where</code>) which uses an association. Let&#39;s dig into these.</p>

<h2 id="where-on-an-association-with-eager_load"><code>where</code> on an association with <code>eager_load</code></h2>

<p>It&#39;s a somewhat frequent need and there are many questions about this on stack overflow.</p>

<p>The bug from the introduction, accidentally doing conditional eager loading, started with such a need: &quot;I want the
posts that have comments marked as spam&quot;.</p>

<p>You may see a recommendation to use <code>includes</code>, and then have a condition on its table. This actually
uses the <code>eager_load</code> path.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Please stop doing this :(</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">includes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">comments: </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">})</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># which is equivalent to this (and don't do this either)</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">eager_load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">comments: </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">})</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Again, this does conditional eager loading, which isn&#39;t what we asked for.</p>

<p>To be clear, the <code>where</code> on an association with <code>includes</code> / <code>eager_load</code> <strong>can</strong> be safe. But only <strong>if</strong>
the association is a <code>belongs_to</code>. When it is, there are only 2 possibilities: either load the
record and the associated <code>belongs_to</code> records, or don&#39;t load either. No conditional eager loading is possible.</p>

<p>But even when it&#39;s safe, there are risks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <code>includes</code> / <code>eager_load</code> increases the chance for a mistake, where you or someone else <em>just</em>
add another association to the existing eager loading call.</li>
<li>Every time a reader sees <code>includes</code> / <code>eager_load</code>, he may wonder if it is safe, or if there could be
accidental conditional eager loading.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>And as a tool, this isn&#39;t so great:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you don&#39;t need the associated records, then eager loading them is wasteful.</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t handle recursive associations (ex: parent/children)</li>
<li><span class="with-tooltip" data-tippy-content="&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A query for posts with &amp;quot;a comment marked as spam&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a comment by an admin&amp;quot; will actually only return posts with &amp;quot;a comment that is both marked as spam and made by an admin&amp;quot; instead it being possible to be two different comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So doing this kind of query in &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; means they can interact incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ">Doesn&#39;t compose well</span></li>
<li>Looks potentially wrong when you know of the conditional eager loading &quot;feature&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-on-an-association-with-joins"><code>where</code> on an association with <code>joins</code></h2>

<p>The next option is to use <code>joins</code>. It also has downsides.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Please stop doing this :(</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">joins</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">comments: </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">})</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># and stop doing this</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">joins</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">distinct</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">comments: </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">})</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>Using <code>joins</code> like this is better than <code>includes</code> / <code>eager_load</code> since at least, there is no risk of conditionally
loading an association. But there are still problems with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doesn&#39;t handle recursive associations (ex: parent/children)</li>
<li>Requires a <code>distinct</code> to avoid duplicated records when used with <code>has_many</code> associations.<br>
This can be unexpected if you&#39;re doing a more complex query than j ust fetching records.</li>
<li><span class="with-tooltip" data-tippy-content="&lt;div class=&quot;markdown-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A query for posts with &amp;quot;a comment marked as spam&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a comment by an admin&amp;quot; will actually only return posts with &amp;quot;a comment that is both marked as spam and made by an admin&amp;quot; instead it being possible to be two different comments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So doing this kind of query in &lt;code&gt;scope&lt;/code&gt; means they can interact incorrectly and change more things than just adding a condition (it adds a &lt;code&gt;distinct&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; ">Doesn&#39;t compose well</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-on-an-association-with-arel"><code>where</code> on an association with Arel</h2>

<p>Truth is, this need for a <code>where</code> on an association isn&#39;t something that ActiveRecord supports well. So
leaving the ActiveRecord only solutions, you can do an actual <code>EXISTS</code> query with Arel. <code>EXISTS</code> is
the SQL tool that is meant to do this type of condition, not <code>JOIN</code>.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># An OK way, but error prone</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Comment</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"posts.id = comments.post_id"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">where</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">arel</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">exists</span><span class="p">)</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>This composes much better with other tools because all it does is add a single <code>WHERE</code> clause to the query.
It works as you would expect with <code>or</code>, <code>not</code> and with other conditions on the same association.</p>

<p>But there still are new downsides:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must manually write condition to link the <code>posts</code> to the <code>comments</code>. It&#39;s easy to forget it, and I&#39;ve seen
StackOverflow answers that forgot to do so.<br>
You won&#39;t get any error for forgetting, your query will just be wrong, which may not even be obvious if all
you have is a little test data.
Bonus: This can get extra tedious for polymorphic associations, where you also need to this check: <code>foos.owner_type = #{Bar.base_class.name}</code>.</li>
<li>If a condition was given when defining the association, you must also manually rewrite it.</li>
<li>Only the models are named in the code, not the association of interest. This makes the intent less clear, especially
when non-trivial associations exist.</li>
<li>Extra work to handle recursive associations (ex: parent/children)</li>
<li>Quite a bit longer to write, and this is a short example.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other than writing the whole condition manually, which would have all the problems of the Arel way, but be
more verbose and more error-prone, I think we&#39;re out of built-in ways.</p>

<div class="highlight lone-highlighted-code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight ruby"><code><span class="c1"># Please consider doing this:</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where_assoc_exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">spam: </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">)</span>&#x000A;<span class="c1"># Or using a scope such as is_spam:</span>&#x000A;<span class="no">Post</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">where_assoc_exists</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:comments</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">is_spam</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></div>
<div class="markdown-body"><p>The query it generates is the same as the Arel example, with the same benefits and more.
See for yourself:</p>

<ul>
<li>It just adds a single <code>where</code> condition, so it composes well and works with <code>or</code> and with
other conditions on the same association.</li>
<li>Handles recursive associations automatically (ex: parent/children)</li>
<li>Handles polymorphic belongs_to (<code>includes</code> and <code>joins</code> would simply refuse)</li>
<li>Easy to do a <code>NOT</code> of the condition (I.E.: where no comment is marked as spam)
with <code>where_assoc_not_exists</code>.</li>
<li>Composes with other such queries, even on the same association, even with negations</li>
<li>Unlike Arel, this uses the association&#39;s name, so the intent is clearer.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if you need to do this kind of condition, here are some references for my gem:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc/blob/master/INTRODUCTION.md">Introduction to activerecord_where_assoc</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc/blob/master/ALTERNATIVES_PROBLEMS.md">The problems of the other ways of doing such conditions</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc/blob/master/EXAMPLES.md">Multiple example usages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s simply no way I could find to use builtin tools to have this query be clear, succinct and not booby trapped.
Either live with the booby traps, write your own methods to do this cleanly, or use one of the gems written for this purpose:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mine: <a href="https://github.com/MaxLap/activerecord_where_assoc">activerecord_where_assoc</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/EugZol/where_exists">where_exists</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously, try any of them, it&#39;s liberating how simple this once complex task becomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="markdown-body"><h2 id="but-includes-is-everywhere">But <code>includes</code> is everywhere</h2>

<p>It is! Let&#39;s explore the reasons I can think of.</p>

<p><strong><code>includes</code> is the &quot;smart&quot; function out of the 3, it will pick the &quot;right&quot; strategy when needed.</strong></p>

<p>Marketing-wise, this sounds like a good thing... Until you learn that the alternate path, <code>eager_load</code>, is
not really what you want and it can cause bugs due to conditional eager loading.</p>

<p><strong>For a long time, <code>includes</code> (and <code>eager_load</code>) were the only way to do a <code>LEFT JOIN</code></strong></p>

<p>The method <code>left_joins</code> was added in Rails 5.0. Before that, if you wanted one, you had to either do
<code>includes</code> / <code>eager_load</code>, or write the whole &quot;LEFT JOIN&quot; yourself like this: <code>joins(&quot;LEFT JOIN&#x000A;comments ON comments.post_id = posts.id&quot;)</code>. The <code>includes</code> shortcut was often suggested.</p>

<p><strong><code>includes</code> has always been recommended, so most are familiar with it, and most recommend it.</strong></p>

<p>Everything is against <code>preload</code>, even it&#39;s <a href="https://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods/preload">documentation</a> makes <code>preload</code>
sound like an <span class="with-tooltip" data-tippy-content="As of writing this post it only says: &quot;Allows preloading of args, in the same way that #includes does&quot;, with one trivial example.">alias for <code>includes</code></span>, and the Rails guide only mentions <code>includes</code> for eager loading data.</p>

<p>I think not enough people were both harmed by <code>includes</code> and aware of the <code>preload</code> option for it to spread.</p>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>Conditional eager loading:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>includes</code> and <code>eager_load</code> can accidentally eager load only part of an association, a good source of bugs.</li>
<li>Doing conditional eager loading voluntarily can be maintenance burden</li>
<li>If you do want conditional eager loading, using <code>eager_load</code> makes it a bit more obvious.</li>
</ul>

<p>Conditions based on associations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <code>includes</code> and <code>eager_load</code> for conditions based on associations does conditional eager loading at
the same time, you will get bitten.</li>
<li>Using specialized gems to do conditions based on association is safer, clearer and easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re left with <code>preload</code>, which only does full eager loading. You should use it!</p>
